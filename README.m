Weekly Shopping List Text Sender

The Purpose
	I began working on this project because I was curious to see if I could write a program that would be applicable to my personal life. I thought though a lot of things and failed before I got to this idea. I first tried a hobby picker, didn’t enjoy my design, and felt it wasn’t as applicable as I could get. I was going into my junior year and had purchased my first apartment and would have to learn to cook and shop for myself for the first time. I came up with the idea of a program that would scan my shopping list information in an excel file and then send it to me on my phone, because I didn’t want to have to write my list down each week or keep track of the same piece of paper.  I also wanted to have a way to edit my shopping list on the go if I were to get any cooking idea that came to mind or suggested to me by a peer or family member. So, what better way to apply my knowledge, simplify my routine and try something new then to write a program to do it all.
